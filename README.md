- 👋 Hi, I’m @Alexflu
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, started using D.O.S. since I was 2 but I mostly do trail and error solo to figure stuff out, I love the work done here <3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, HTML, Binary, general coding I suppose?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that peaks my interest and is "challenging"
- 📫 How to reach me alexflu009@gmail.com
